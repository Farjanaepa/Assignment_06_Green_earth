1. Difference between var, let and const :

var : declares variable with function and allows re-declaration and update within same scope.

let : Declares variables with block scope but no re-declaration within the same block.

const : Block-scope variables that can't be re-assigned.

2. map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with update.

forEach() executes same code on every element in an array but does not change the array.

filter() checks every element in an array creates new array containing only the elements that pass a certain condition.

3. Arrow functions allows a shorter syntax for function Expression.

4. Destructuring is a javascript feature that allows to extract values from objects or arrays into distinct variables.

5. Template literals are a new way in ES6 to create strings use (``) instead of ('' or ""), it makes easier, cleaner and flexible to include variables and multi line strings.

for example : 

const exm = "My name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.";

const exm = `My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
